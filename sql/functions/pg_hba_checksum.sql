/*
 * Can't just do a raw check for the hash value since Prometheus only records numeric values for alerts
 * If checksum function returns 0, then NO settings have changed
 * If checksum function returns 1, then something has changed since last known valid state
 * For replicas, logging past settings is not possible to compare what may have changed
 * For replicas, by default, it is expected that its settings will match the primary
 * For replicas, if the pg_settings or pg_hba.conf are necessarily different from the primary, a known good hash of that replica's
    settings can be sent as an argument to the relevant checksum function. Views are provided to easily obtain the hash values used by this monitoring tool.
 * If any known hash parameters are passed to the checksum functions, note that it will override any past hash values stored in the log table when doing comparisons and completely re-evaluate the entire state. This is true even if done on a primary where the current state will then also be logged for comparison if it differs from the given hash.
